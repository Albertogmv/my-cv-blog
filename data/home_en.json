I also have experience with FastAPI and Flask, creating high-performance APIs in Python.\nI have worked with data processing, web scraping, digital image handling, and data manipulation with Pandas. I manage relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite, as well as MongoDB in NoSQL environments.\nRegarding software quality, I have experience with automated testing using JUnit, Mockito, and Cucumber, as well as tools like SonarQube and Dependency-Track. I have also managed CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins.\nOn the frontend side, I have knowledge of Angular and TypeScript, along with test automation using Selenium and Python.\nI consider myself proactive, adaptable, and growth-oriented, with experience in agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) and used to dynamic environments. My passion for technology drives me to continuously evolve, explore new trends, and take every solution to the next level.\nWhile continuing this active job search, I have taken the opportunity to further my education by completing courses on SOLID Principles and Clean Code (Udemy) and Advanced Python Programming. You can find these and other details in the Training section of this blog, which I am developing with Python, Flask, and Jinja2.
